<h2>About</h2>
We’re all quite used to our good old decimal system of numerals. But let’s not forget that there are other ways to count! Whether we need to convert numbers from one system to another just for fun or to store large data more efficiently, a converter proves helpful. In this project, you will create your own tool that will help you convert numbers from one system to another.

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
You will master loops and functions, learn about numeric data types, and explore different numeral systems including binary — one of the basic concepts in programming.

Task Details

<ul>
<li>Convert decimals: Learn the basics of input and output to implement a simple logic: teach the program to convert the user input number to binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems.</li>
<li>Convert to decimal: Practice loop, function, and string processing and give your program new functionality: converting user input numbers to the decimal system. Also, add commands to determine what the program should do next.</li>
<li>Convert to any base: Upgrade your converter: enable it to convert numbers between any numeral systems. While you're at it, master loops and learn how to store large numbers.</li>
<li>Convert fractions: Make it possible for the converter to work with fractions, especially with large fractional numbers.</li>
</ul>
